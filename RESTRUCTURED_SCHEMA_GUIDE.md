# üìä RESTRUCTURED DATABASE SCHEMA GUIDE

## üéØ **OVERVIEW**

This restructured schema is based on your original `DB Schema.sql` with professional enhancements and correct stream logic implementation. It maintains full compatibility with your existing application code while adding advanced features.

## üîß **KEY PRINCIPLES IMPLEMENTED**

### **‚úÖ CORRECT STREAM LOGIC:**
- **ONLY CLASSES** are stream-specific (have `stream_id`)
- **ALL OTHER TABLES** are global (courses, lecturers, rooms, departments, programs)
- **STREAMS** control time periods and which classes are active

### **‚úÖ PROFESSIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:**
- **Quality scoring system** (0-50 points) for class-course assignments
- **Department-oriented validation** with professional rules
- **Real-time compatibility checking** and validation
- **Comprehensive audit trails** and monitoring
- **Performance optimizations** with proper indexing

## üìã **SCHEMA STRUCTURE**

### **üåê GLOBAL TABLES (Shared across all streams)**

#### **1. Core Academic Structure:**
```sql
departments (id, name, code, short_name, head_of_department, email, phone)
programs (id, department_id, name, code, degree_type, duration_years) -- NO stream_id
levels (id, name, code, numeric_value, min_credits, max_credits)
courses (id, code, name, department_id, level_id, course_type, prerequisites) -- NO stream_id
lecturers (id, staff_id, name, title, email, department_id, rank, specialization) -- NO stream_id
```

#### **2. Infrastructure:**
```sql
buildings (id, name, code, address, floors_count, accessibility_features)
room_types (id, name, description, equipment_required)
rooms (id, name, code, building_id, room_type, capacity, equipment) -- NO stream_id
days (id, name, short_name, sort_order, is_weekend)
time_slots (id, start_time, end_time, duration, slot_name, is_break)
```

#### **3. Relationship Tables:**
```sql
lecturer_courses (id, lecturer_id, course_id, is_primary, competency_level)
course_room_types (id, course_id, room_type_id, priority, is_required)
```

### **üéØ STREAM-SPECIFIC TABLES**

#### **1. Stream Management:**
```sql
streams (id, name, code, period_start, period_end, break_start, break_end, 
         active_days, max_daily_hours, color_code, is_current)
stream_time_slots (id, stream_id, time_slot_id, priority, is_active)
stream_days (id, stream_id, day_id, is_active)
```

#### **2. Classes (ONLY stream-specific table):**
```sql
classes (id, program_id, level_id, name, code, stream_id, academic_year, 
         semester, total_capacity, current_enrollment, divisions_count,
         class_coordinator, preferred_start_time, max_daily_courses)
```

### **üìö ASSIGNMENT & SCHEDULING TABLES**

#### **1. Professional Class-Course Assignments:**
```sql
class_courses (id, class_id, course_id, lecturer_id, semester, academic_year,
               assignment_type, assigned_by, approval_status, quality_score,
               validation_notes, is_mandatory)
```

#### **2. Enhanced Timetable:**
```sql
timetable (id, class_id, course_id, lecturer_id, room_id, day_id, time_slot_id,
           semester, academic_year, division_label, timetable_type,
           session_duration, notes, created_by, approved_by)
timetable_lecturers (id, timetable_id, lecturer_id, role) -- For team teaching
```

### **üìä MONITORING & AUDIT TABLES**

```sql
timetable_generation_log (id, stream_id, semester, total_assignments,
                         successful_placements, failed_placements,
                         generation_time_seconds, generated_by)
professional_config (id, config_key, config_value, config_type, category)
```

## üîß **PROFESSIONAL FEATURES ADDED**

### **1. Quality Scoring System (0-50 points):**
- **Level Match:** 25 points (MANDATORY)
- **Department Match:** 20 points (PREFERRED for core courses)
- **Course Type Bonus:** Core (15), Practical (12), Elective (8)
- **Cross-Departmental:** Allowed for electives (8 points), blocked for core

### **2. Enhanced Validation:**
```sql
-- Professional validation function
FUNCTION validate_class_course_professional(class_id, course_id) 
RETURNS JSON -- {valid: boolean, quality_score: int, errors: array, warnings: array}

-- Professional assignment procedure  
PROCEDURE assign_course_professional(class_id, course_id, lecturer_id, ...)
-- Validates before assignment and calculates quality score
```

### **3. Professional Views:**
```sql
-- Comprehensive class information with stream context
VIEW classes_comprehensive 

-- Assignment quality monitoring with professional metrics
VIEW assignment_quality_professional

-- Real-time compatibility scoring and recommendations
```

### **4. Data Integrity Features:**
- **Check constraints** for data validation
- **Unique constraints** to prevent conflicts
- **Foreign key constraints** for referential integrity
- **Professional triggers** for automatic quality calculation

## üìà **ENHANCEMENTS FROM ORIGINAL SCHEMA**

### **MAINTAINED FROM ORIGINAL:**
- ‚úÖ All table names and basic structure
- ‚úÖ Existing foreign key relationships
- ‚úÖ Compatible with current application code
- ‚úÖ Stream logic: only classes have `stream_id`

### **PROFESSIONAL ADDITIONS:**
- ‚úÖ **Quality scoring** for assignments (0-50 scale)
- ‚úÖ **Professional validation** functions and procedures
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced data types** (JSON for flexibility)
- ‚úÖ **Audit trails** and change tracking
- ‚úÖ **Performance indexes** for optimal queries
- ‚úÖ **Academic metadata** (semester, academic_year)
- ‚úÖ **Professional constraints** and validation rules

### **REMOVED INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATIONS:**
- ‚ùå Removed `stream_id` from programs table (programs are global)
- ‚ùå Fixed any incorrect stream filtering logic
- ‚ùå Removed unnecessary complexity that didn't match business logic

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**

```

## üéØ **BUSINESS LOGIC FLOW**

```
1. USER SELECTS STREAM (Regular/Weekend/Evening)
   ‚Üì
2. SYSTEM SHOWS CLASSES for selected stream only
   (classes table filtered by stream_id)
   ‚Üì
3. SYSTEM SHOWS ALL COURSES (global - no stream filter)
   with professional compatibility scoring
   ‚Üì
4. PROFESSIONAL VALIDATION:
   - Level must match (25 points - MANDATORY)
   - Department should match for core courses (20 points)
   - Cross-departmental OK for electives (8 points)
   - Quality threshold: minimum 15/50 for approval
   ‚Üì
5. TIMETABLE GENERATION:
   - Uses stream-specific classes and time periods
   - Uses global lecturers, rooms, and courses
   - Applies professional conflict detection
   - Prioritizes high-quality assignments
```
