# Stream-Based Filtering Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds stream-based filtering to the entire timetable system, ensuring that all data displayed and managed in admin pages is filtered based on the currently selected stream (Regular, Weekend, or Evening).

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `stream_id` column to key tables:
  - `courses`
  - `lecturers` 
  - `rooms`
  - `departments`
  - `programs`
- All existing records are assigned to stream_id = 1 (Regular) by default
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

### 2. Stream Management System
- **Stream Manager Class** (`includes/stream_manager.php`):
  - Manages current stream selection via PHP sessions
  - Provides helper functions for stream filtering
  - Automatically filters SQL queries by current stream
  - Handles stream changes and persistence

### 3. Stream Selector in Header
- Added dropdown stream selector in the main navigation bar
- Shows current stream selection
- Allows users to switch between streams (Regular, Weekend, Evening)
- Automatically reloads page to show filtered data

### 4. Updated Admin Pages
The following admin pages now filter data by current stream:

#### Classes Management (`classes.php`)
- Classes list filtered by current stream
- Department dropdown filtered by current stream
- New classes automatically assigned to current stream

#### Courses Management (`courses.php`)
- Courses list filtered by current stream
- Department dropdown filtered by current stream
- New courses automatically assigned to current stream
- Bulk import respects current stream

#### Lecturers Management (`lecturers.php`)
- Lecturers list filtered by current stream
- Department dropdown filtered by current stream
- New lecturers automatically assigned to current stream
- Bulk import respects current stream

## How It Works

### 1. Stream Selection
- User selects a stream from the dropdown in the header
- Selection is sent via AJAX to `change_stream.php`
- Stream ID is stored in PHP session
- Page reloads to show filtered data

### 2. Data Filtering
- All database queries automatically include stream filtering
- Uses `$streamManager->getCurrentStreamId()` to get current stream
- SQL queries modified to include `AND stream_id = X` conditions

### 3. New Record Creation
- When creating new records, `stream_id` is automatically set to current stream
- Ensures all new data belongs to the selected stream

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `STREAM_FILTERING_SCHEMA.sql` - Database schema updates
- `includes/stream_manager.php` - Stream management class
- `change_stream.php` - AJAX handler for stream changes
- `STREAM_FILTERING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `includes/header.php` - Added stream selector and JavaScript
- `classes.php` - Added stream filtering
- `courses.php` - Added stream filtering  
- `lecturers.php` - Added stream filtering

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators
1. **Select Stream**: Use the dropdown in the top navigation bar to choose between Regular, Weekend, or Evening streams
2. **View Filtered Data**: All admin pages will automatically show only data relevant to the selected stream
3. **Add New Data**: New records (classes, courses, lecturers, etc.) will automatically be assigned to the current stream

### For Developers
1. **Include Stream Manager**: Add `include 'includes/stream_manager.php';` to any page that needs stream filtering
2. **Get Stream Manager**: Use `$streamManager = getStreamManager();` to get the stream manager instance
3. **Filter Queries**: Use `$streamManager->getCurrentStreamId()` to add stream filtering to SQL queries
4. **Add Stream ID**: Include `stream_id` when inserting new records

## Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Each stream's data is completely separate
2. **Cleaner Interface**: Users only see relevant data for their stream
3. **Reduced Confusion**: No mixing of data between different streams
4. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of Regular, Weekend, and Evening programs
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add more streams in the future

## Future Enhancements

1. **Stream-Specific Settings**: Different time slots, room preferences per stream
2. **Stream Templates**: Pre-configured settings for each stream type
3. **Stream Analytics**: Reports and statistics per stream
4. **User Permissions**: Different access levels per stream
5. **Stream Export**: Export data specific to each stream

## Technical Notes

- Uses PHP sessions for stream persistence
- AJAX-based stream switching for smooth user experience
- Automatic page reload ensures consistent data display
- Foreign key constraints maintain data integrity
- Backward compatible with existing data (all assigned to Regular stream by default)
