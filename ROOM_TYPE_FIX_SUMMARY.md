# Room Type "Data Truncated" Error - Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was getting this error when trying to add rooms:
```
Fatal error: Uncaught mysqli_sql_exception: Data truncated for column 'room_type' at row 1
```

## Root Cause
**Database Schema Mismatch**: The `rooms.room_type` column was defined as an ENUM with specific values, but the application code was designed to work with VARCHAR and was trying to insert values that didn't exactly match the ENUM constraints.

**Before (ENUM - causing errors):**
```sql
room_type ENUM('classroom','lecture_hall','laboratory','computer_lab','seminar_room','auditorium') NOT NULL
```

**After (VARCHAR - flexible and working):**
```sql
room_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL COMMENT 'Expected values: classroom, lecture_hall, laboratory, computer_lab, seminar_room, auditorium'
```

## Solution
Migrate the `room_type` column from ENUM to VARCHAR to match the application's design.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Run the Migration Script
Execute this SQL in phpMyAdmin or MySQL client:
```sql
ALTER TABLE rooms MODIFY COLUMN room_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL COMMENT 'Expected values: classroom, lecture_hall, laboratory, computer_lab, seminar_room, auditorium';
```

### 2. Verify the Migration
Run the test script: `test_room_type_migration.php`
- Visit this file in your browser
- It should show "✅ SUCCESS: room_type is now VARCHAR. Migration completed!"

### 3. Test the Fix
- Try adding a single room through the form
- Try importing rooms via CSV
- Both should work without "Data truncated" errors

## Files Modified

### 1. `migrate_room_type_to_varchar.sql`
- Migration script to change ENUM to VARCHAR

### 2. `schema.sql`
- Updated to reflect VARCHAR instead of ENUM

### 3. `test_room_type_migration.php`
- Test script to verify migration success

### 4. `rooms.php`
- Already updated to work with VARCHAR
- Includes comprehensive validation and mapping

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Flexibility**: VARCHAR allows any string value up to 50 characters
2. **Application Logic**: The app already has hardcoded validation and mapping
3. **Data Integrity**: Application-level validation ensures only valid room types are inserted
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new room types without database changes

## Expected Results

After migration:
- ✅ Single room addition works
- ✅ CSV bulk import works
- ✅ No more "Data truncated" errors
- ✅ Room type validation still enforced at application level
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Validation
The application validates room types using this mapping:
```php
$room_type_mappings = [
    'Classroom' => 'classroom',
    'Lecture Hall' => 'lecture_hall',
    'Laboratory' => 'laboratory',
    'Computer Lab' => 'computer_lab',
    'Seminar Room' => 'seminar_room',
    'Auditorium' => 'auditorium'
];
```

## Next Steps
1. Run the migration script
2. Test with `test_room_type_migration.php`
3. Try adding rooms again
4. Test CSV import functionality

The "Data truncated" error should be completely resolved!
